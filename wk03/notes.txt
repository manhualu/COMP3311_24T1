Single table with nulls

R(a is NOT NULL, b is NOT NULL, c is NULL, d is NULL)
S(a is NOT NULL, b is NULL, c is NOT null, d is NULL)


Q20. Regex can be used as a domain constraint.
Refer to the regex cheat sheet I've added to this week's folder.

e.g. 
    create domain TaxFileNum as char(11) 
                    check (value ~ '^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}$')

    This just means that the TaxFileNum should be in the format of 012-345-678.
